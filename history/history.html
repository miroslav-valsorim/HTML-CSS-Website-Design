                        Società Italiana Automobili Darracq was set up in 1906, at first in Naples, but soon moving to Milan, to the Portello
                        district, then on the outskirts of the city. The initial enthusiasm and great ambitions were temporarily dampened in
                        1909, with the arrival of a severe economic crisis. Cavalier Ugo Stella, managing director of the company, promoted the
                        setting up of a new company in an attempt to improve the factory's fortunes. On 24 June 1910, the new company name,
                        A.L.F.A. (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili) was officially registered. At that time, Giuseppe Merosi had already
                        prepared the project for the model that was to become the brand's first historical car: the 24 HP. Yet despite the
                        success of the early vehicles, A.L.F.A. was unable to take off from the financial point of view. At the onset of World
                        War I, failure to obtain an order from the government brought about the early winding up of the company, which was
                        entrusted to the Banca Italiana di Sconto (BIS). In the meantime, a young entrepreneur from Naples named Nicola Romeo,
                        also backed BIS, had set up a company called Ing. Nicola Romeo & C, and had built a small factory very close to
                        Portello, obtaining an important order in 1915 for the production of shells. The Romeo workshop, however, was not large
                        enough to produce this order, while not far away were the A.L.F.A. premises that had shortly before been put into
                        liquidation. BIS took over the shares of A.L.F.A. and entrusted its management to Nicola Romeo & C. Business grew
                        relentlessly and, in February 1918, the investors decided to make the company public. Its name became Società Anonima
                        Italiana Nicola Romeo & C., that is Alfa Romeo. During the war, car production had not even been taken into
                        consideration by Romeo and Merosi had been moved to the railway carriage plant in Naples. Only at the end of 1919, after
                        the war had ended, did car production resume, initially with the assembly of parts in stock, then with the design of new
                        models. It was the beginning of a new era.

                    <p>
                        In the early twenties, a masterpiece by Giuseppe Merosi, the RL, was presented. Additionally, in 1923, Ugo Sivocci drove
                        the first car with the Quadrifoglio symbol achieving a great win in the Targa Florio. After these successes, a glorious
                        era began with Vittorio Jano, the Gran Premio Tipo P2 and victory in the first World Championship, leading to the
                        inclusion of the famous laurel wreath in the brand's badge. Alfa Romeo enjoyed a period of great popularity, with
                        internationally famous iconic models and racing success that appeared to be unstoppable. Added to this was the
                        production of new aeronautical engines and industrial vehicles. However, undermined by the global crisis, the economic
                        situation again became very difficult. While Alfa Romeo's image was one of a solid company, “manufacturer of the best
                        Italian cars”, viewed with admiration even by Henry Ford, the reality was very different. In 1933, weighed down by
                        debts, Alfa Romeo was purchased by the IRI, the state-owned Institute for Industrial Reconstruction and a new Director
                        General, Ugo Gobbato, was appointed. Gobbato enjoyed considerable support from the government. He succeeded in turning
                        Alfa into a major organised and efficient industrial company, able to produce cars, aircraft engines and heavy duty
                        vehicles. In 1935, the company was militarised and in 1939 the first stone was laid for the new factory in Pomigliano
                        d'Arco, near Naples, devoted to aeronautical production. The whole racing area was entrusted to the Scuderia Ferrari and
                        it is from this time that many legendary cars date: 6C 2300, 6C 2500, 8C 2300 and 8C 2900 B. This golden era was
                        followed by the years of World War II, with its decentralisation and bombings. At the same time, however, they were
                        decisive years in which the future of Alfa after the war was planned.

                    <p>
                        In 1945, Gobbato was murdered and the task of demilitarising Alfa Romeo was entrusted to Pasquale Gallo. Meanwhile,
                        Orazio Satta Puliga and his team took over management of the design department. Production slowly started up again, but
                        it was by then clear that the company could no longer continue to make elitist and hand-crafted cars and would have
                        industrialise its production. In the meantime, the “Alfetta” 158 and 159 models dominated the first two World
                        Championships in the new Formula 1 class and the 1900 made its début on the market, the first car produced without a
                        separate chassis and made on an assembly line. At the beginning of the Fifties, Giuseppe Luraghi joined the top
                        management of the company, where he would remain until 1974. It would be a period of enormous development: the Giulietta
                        and Giulia models would bring unexpected growth to Alfa Romeo, with an image return beyond all prediction. At the
                        beginning of the Seventies, construction would begin on the new plant in Arese and the Balocco race track. Lastly, the
                        Alfasud project would be launched, while “Alfa Nord” would put the ultra-modern Alfetta into production along with the
                        models derived from it: modern, fast, technologically advanced cars appreciated by the market.
                        The energy crisis and a difficult social, trade union, political and management situation, however, soon brought new
                        problems.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 1986, the Alfa Romeo crisis seemed irreversible and Finmeccanica was forced to sell the company to the Fiat Group.
                        Controversial years followed in which racing and commercial successes were alternated with much less prosperous times.
                        It was the period of the 164 and the 155, up to the great progress marked by the 156, 147, 8C Competizione, Mito and
                        Giulietta. And at last the 4C, which is openening up a new era. In the meantime, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has been set
                        up and the foundations have been laid for a great revival that will start precisely from Alfa Romeo, from Milao, from
                        its tradition and from its future.

                    <p>
                        Five world titles, among which the First World Championship for Grand Prix vehicles in 1925, and the first two Formula 1
                        Championships in 1950 and 1951. Then, 11 Mille Miglia, 10 Targa Florios, 4 editions of the 24 Hour Le Mans, and hundreds
                        of trophies among Sports and Tourism categories, all write the legendary and unique racing history of Alfa Romeo. Under
                        the sign of the Quadrifoglio.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A.L.F.A. was established in 1910 and immediately its attention was focused on the races: it debuted in the races already
                        with its very first vehicles, then developed the futuristic and refined project of the Grand Prix 1914, whose career was
                        stopped short only by the First World War. The first, great international victory was the 1923 Targa Florio, dominated
                        by Ugo Sivocci with the RL: the bonnet displayed a four-leaf clover, which from lucky-charm was to become the symbol of
                        all Alfa Romeo race cars in the future, and, from the '60s onwards, would identify the more sporty versions of
                        production vehicles.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the meantime, the first World Championship for Grand Prix vehicles was announced, the forerunner of F1 races, and
                        Nicola Romeo, who had taken control of the company by then and given it his own name, asked Vittorio Jano to design a
                        vehicle capable of making him look good. The GP Tipo P2, innovative, reliable, and extremely fast, would conquer the
                        first world title in 1925, undefeated, and give rise to that laurel leaf crown that was inserted into the Alfa Romeo
                        brand thereafter. Antonio Ascari, Giuseppe Campari, and Gastone Brilli Peri were the captains of that triumph.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the '20s and '30s, Alfa Romeo was unbeatable among Sports vehicles, and won 11 editions of the Mille Miglia as well
                        as four 24 Hour Le Mans races, while the one-seaters Gran Premio Tipo B were the stars of immortal endeavours with Tazio
                        Nuvolari, Achille Varzi, and Rudolf Caracciola.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 1933, Alfa Romeo became state-owned and the races were managed by Scuderia Ferrari, while Gran Prix victories kept
                        rolling in with the Tipo C, capable of winning and stunning the American Vanderbilt Cup in 1936. Then the slim 1.5 litre
                        "vetturetta" GP Tipo 158 had its debut; it was nicknamed "Alfetta" and destined for a radiant future.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After the break imposed by the war period, post-war "Alfettas" had no rivals. In 1950, the new Formula 1 World
                        Championship was inaugurated, and for the Tipo 158 it meant eleven victories in 11 races with Giuseppe "Nino" Farina
                        winning the title, followed the next year by Juan Manuel Fangio on the Tipo 159. However, Alfa Romeo needed to
                        concentrate its efforts on re-launching the production, and decided to withdraw from the races, undefeated.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Strong with the success of the Giulietta and with the Giulia just presented to the press, the official return to the
                        races came with Autodelta in the 1960s: it resulted in a hegemony among Tourism vehicles with the GTA, while the career
                        of the Tipo 33 started to take off: in ten years it collected an impressive number of victories among Sports vehicles,
                        which culminated with two World Championships in 1975 and 1977. They were the years of De Adamich, Zeccoli, Merzario,
                        and Vaccarella. A string of successes that pushed Alfa Romeo to once again access Formula 1, first by providing the
                        engines for the Brabham team, and then – from 1979 to 1975 – with a complete vehicle and drivers of the calibre of Bruno
                        Giacomelli, Vittorio Brambilla, Patrick Depailler, Mario Andretti, Riccardo Patrese, and Eddie Cheever. Once the
                        adventure of Formula 1 was over, Autodelta relinquished the task to Alfa Corse, which went back to competing in many
                        categories and dominated in Tourism, until the years 2000, with the 155 and 156 and drivers like Larini, Nannini,
                        Francia, Giovanardi, and Tarquini.
